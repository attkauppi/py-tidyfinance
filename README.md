Helper functions for empirical research in financial economics, addressing a variety of topics covered in [Scheuch, Frey, Voigt, and Weiss (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781032684307). The package is designed to provide shortcuts for issues extensively discussed in the book, facilitating easier application of its concepts.

## Installation

You can install the release version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tidyfinance/):

```
pip install tidyfinance
```

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/tidy-finance/py-tidyfinance"
```

## Usage

The main functionality of the `tidyfinance` package centers around data download. You can download most of the data that we used in Tidy Finance with R using the `download_data()` function or its children. 

```python
from tidyfinance import download_data
```

For instance, to download monthly Fama-French factors:

```python
download_data(
  type="factors_ff_3_monthly", 
  start_date="2000-01-01", 
  end_date="2020-12-31"
)
```
